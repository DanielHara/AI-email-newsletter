# AI-email-reply
Use AI to reply to emails

Side project to use AI to reply to emails, built with TypeScript and React, running on node

To run the "hello world" script to send a simple email:

I'm using https://resend.com. So, create a .env file:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=<RESEND_API_KEY>
```

And then:
```
npm install && npx tsx send.tsx
```

You get:

Still in progress...

The goal is eventually to build a service to automatically answer customer queries by email.
